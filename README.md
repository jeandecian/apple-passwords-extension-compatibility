# Apple Passwords Extension Compatibility

This repository aims to document the compatibility of the "Apple Passwords" extension with different web browsers and operating systems.

The "Apple Passwords" extension allows users to access their passwords and passkeys stored in iCloud Keychain directly from third-party browsers.
However, compatibility issues can arise. This project seeks to provide a centralized resource to identify these issues and share known solutions or workarounds.

## Objectives

* List tested browsers and their versions.
* Document operating systems on which the extension works (or doesn't).
* Identify common problems and their solutions.
* Provide instructions for reproducing issues.
